# Real-Time Weather Data Processing System

## English Description

### Overview
This project is currently under development. It aims to establish a real-time weather data processing system that captures weather conditions using WebSocket, processes and stores the data via a gRPC service in MongoDB, and forwards it to a RabbitMQ queue for further processing. The integration of WebSocket, gRPC, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building scalable and efficient data processing systems.

### Project Goals
- **Real-Time Data Acquisition**: Implement WebSocket to capture live weather data continuously.
- **Efficient Data Processing and Storage**: Use gRPC for data transmission between client and server, and MongoDB for storing the data effectively.
- **Message Queuing**: Integrate RabbitMQ to manage data flow and enable scalable system architecture.

### Future Applications
Once completed, this system will serve multiple purposes:
- Providing real-time weather updates to users and systems.
- Serving as a backend service for weather data analysis and forecasting applications.
- Demonstrating a scalable architecture for real-time data processing which can be adapted to other domains.
